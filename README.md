OpenFinance S3 - Smart Securities Standard
==

Overview
--

S3 has grown out of the OpenFinance Network's efforts to automate certain
aspects of running a compliant alternatives exchange.  Currently, it consists
of a smart contract library and a typescript library for manipulating these
contracts.  However, the full scope includes a standard protocol that exchanges
an compliance providers can use to communicate in order to maintain the trading
invariants required by the SEC for securities to keep their filing exemptions.

Architecture
--

![Architecture diagram](arch.png)

The _simplified_ S3 architecture provides a permissioned token with no rule
checking on chain.  There are three classes of contracts.

- `CapTables`: All securities issued on S3 share this contract, which is only
  responsible for being the single source of truth for cap tables.
- `TokenFront`: This contract provides a fixed Ethereum address for a given
  security.  All calls are forwarded to a contract expressing rule logic.
- `SimpliedLogic`: This contract implements a two stage clearing and settlement
  protocol.  Users create token transfer requests by calling `transfer` and
  `transferFrom` on the associated `TokenFront`.  Then a third party resolves
  each transfer request by providing an error code.  Only on error code `0` is
  the transfer settled.

How to use the contracts
--

Start by having a look at `src/Types.ts`.  Here is a simple example of
programmatic online issuing:

```typescript
import * as s3 from "@openfinance/smart-securities-standard";
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from "fs";
import * as Web3 from "web3";

const capTablesAddress = readFileSync("soon-to-be-deployed-s3-capTables.address", "utf8");
const security: s3.BaseSecurity = JSON.parse(readFileSync("mySecurity.json", "utf8"));

const prov = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545");
const web3 = new Web3(prov);

async function go() {
  const record = await s3.issue(
    security, 
    capTablesAddress, 
    deploymentAddress, 
    Web3.eth
  );
  writeFileSync("my-deployment-record.json", JSON.stringify(record), "utf8");
}

go();
```

The command line tool
--

S3 ships with a command line tool you can access at `npm run cli -- --help`.
To use the tool, create two files: `config.json` and `spec.json` and any number
of secrurity declarations.  See [here][cli-files] for the appropriate format
for these files or generate examples as explained in the development section below.

[cli-files]: https://github.com/OpenFinanceIO/smart-securities-standard/blob/offline/run/cli/Types.ts

Summary of commands:

- `init`: Deploy an instance of `CapTables` (this is safe to do online)
- `issue-online`: Deploy the `SimplifiedLogic` and `TokenFront` of an S3 token,
  and configure them according to the declaration files. 
- `audit-issuance`: Given the configuration, declarations, and output generated
  by `issue-online`, confirm that the on-chain deployment matches the
  declaration.
- `new-administration`: Deploy an instance of the `Administration` contract for
  2-of-3 multisig management of the S3 deployment.
- `audit-administration`: Confirm that an instance of `Administration` is
  configured according to a given declaration.

Issuing and maintaining
--

Manual issuance proceeds in several stages.

- **Stage I.** Choose a deployed `CapTables` contract and send a transaction
  which calls `initialize` with your total supply.  This will create a new
  security, owned by the caller and will give you the index of the security.
  The caller will hold the entire balance.
- **Stage II.**  Make calls to `CapTables.transfer` to configure the initial
  distribution of your security.
- **Stage III.** Deploy `SimplifiedLogic` to address `logicAddress`, then
  deploy `TokenFront` with construction parameter `logicAddress`.  Call
  `setFront` on `SimplifiedLogic` with the address of the `TokenFront` to
  authorize it to call in. 
- **Stage IV.** Make some provision to detect and resolve transfer requests.
  `SimplifiedLogic` will log `TransferRequest` messages as users attempt to
  move tokens around.
- **Stage V.** If you need to modify the logic that governs token transfers,
  use the `migrate` method of `CapTables` and `TokenFront`.

### Administration

There is a simple web app for signing `Administration` calls.  Build it with
`npm run build-all` and then invoke `npm run start-admin-app -- --port
$YOUR_FAVORITE_PORT`.  Then navigate to `http://localhost:$YOUR_PORT`.  The app
is intended to be used with MetaMask.

_NOTE:_ When deploying with the `Administration` contract, the sequence of operations is:

1. Deploy `CapTables` if neccessary (cli: `init`).
2. Deploy `Administration` (cli: `new-administration`).
3. Deploy `SimplifiedLogic` and `TokenFront` (cli: `issue-online`) using the
   address of the freshly deployed `Administration` contract.
4. Use the web app to cosign `bind` twice, attaching the `Administration` to the token.
5. Use the web app for management tasks like clawbacks and upgrades.

Implemented Regulations
==

An S3 token can be managed using the `handleTransfers<A>` function.  To use
this function, you must implement:

```typescript
// A decider with the restriction logic.  It should return a pair [code, x]
// where code is the error code (success = 0) and x is a payload that is consumed
// by the finalizer.
declare decision: (tr: Transfer) => Promise<[number, A]>

// A finalizer, which is used e.g. to persist the resolution hash and error
// code to a database.
declare finalization: (txHash: string, extraData: A) => Promise<void>;
```

Setting up S3 for development
==

Please see `contributing.md`.

In order to develop S3, you'll need to have some programs installed:

* [`solc`][solc] 
* [`jq`][jq]
* `typescript`, which can be installed with `npm install -g typescript` (or
  through your system package manager)

Then S3 can be set up like this:  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenFinanceIO/smart-securities-standard.git
$ cd smart-securities-standard
$ git submodule init && git submodule update # get OpenZeppelin contracts
$ npm install
$ npm run compile
$ npm run cli -- --help # see cli options
```

The tests expect to find [`ganache-cli`][ganache] listening at
`localhost:8545`.  Once `ganache-cli` has been started:
```
$ # run the test cases
$ npm test -- -t 30000
```

There is a script `new_instance.sh` that can be used to quickly get a
deployment of S3 up on the test network.  Put 5 addresses that you can sign in 
a file, one per line, then invoke `xargs ./new_instance.sh < $ADDRESS_FILE`.
This will generate example configuration, declarations, and outputs in a
temporary folder.
